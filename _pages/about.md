Hi! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Harvard University Department of Statistics](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/). My studies are supported by the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF GRFP)](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).  I spent the previous two years as a [Research Fellow at the Stanford Graduate School of Business](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/research-fellows). I am interested in causal inference, reinforcement learning, and the applications of statistics to the social and health sciences. My CV is available [here](http://scmcdonald.github.io/files/cv.pdf).

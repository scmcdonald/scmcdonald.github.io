Hi! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Harvard University Department of Statistics](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/). I spent the previous two years as a [Research Fellow at the Stanford Graduate School of Business](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/research-fellows). I am interested in causal inference, reinforcement learning, and the applications of statistics to the social and health sciences. My CV is available here.
